# Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves are very useful objects because they allow us to obtain a group structure with interesting properties. Given a field \\( \mathcal{F} \\), an elliptic curve is the set of points \\( (x,y) \\) which satisfy the following equation: \\[ y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6 \\]  This is known as the general Weierstrass equation. In many cases, this can be written in the simpler form \\[ y^2=x^3+ax+b \\]  which is the (Weierstrass) short-form. Depending on the choice of the parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and the field, the curve can have some desired properties or not. If \\( 4a^3+27b^2 \neq 0 \\), the curve is non-singular.

We can define an operation which allows us to sum elements belonging to the elliptic curve and obtain a group. This is done using a geometric construction, the chord-and-tangent rule. Given two points on the curve \\( P_1=(x_1,y_1) \\) and \\( P_2=(x_2,y_2) \\), we can draw a line connecting them. That line intersects the curve on a third point \\( P_3=(x_3,y_3) \\). We set the sum of \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) as \\( (x_3,-y_3) \\), that is, point \\( P_3 \\) flipped around the \\( x \\)-axis. The formulae are:
\\( s=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \\)
\\( x_3=s^2-x_1-x_2 \\)
\\( y_3=s(x_1-x_3)-y_1 \\)

We can easily see that we have a problem if we try to sum \\( P_1=(x_1,y_1) \\) and \\( P_2=(x_1,-y_1) \\). We need to add an additional point to the system, which we call the point at infinity \\( \mathcal{O} \\). This inclusion is necessary to be able to define the group structure and works as the identity element for the group operation. 

Another problem appears when we want to sum \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_1 \\) to get to \\( P_3=2P_1 \\). But, if we draw the tangent line to the curve on \\( P_1 \\), we see that it intersects the curve at another point. If we want to perform this operation, we need to find the slope of the tangent line and find the intersection:
\\( s=\frac{3x_1^2+a}{2y_1} \\)
\\( x_3=s^2-2x_1 \\)
\\( y_3=s(x_1-x_3)-y_1 \\)

It takes a little bit of work, but we can prove that the elliptic curve with this operation has the properties of a group. We will use finite fields to work with these curves and the groups that we will obtain are finite cyclic groups, that is, groups which can be generated by repeteadly using the operation on a generator, \\( g \\): \\( \{g,2g,3g,4g,5g,...\} \\).

If we plot the collection of points onto a graph, we see that the points are distributed in a rather "random" fashion. For example, \\( 2g \\) could be very far from \\( 3g \\) which in turn are very far from \\( 4g \\). If we wanted to know how many times \\( k \\) we have to add the generator to arrive at a certain point \\( P \\) (that is solving the equation \\( kg=P \\)) we see that we don't have an easy strategy and we are forced to perform a brute search over all possible \\( k \\). This problem is known as the (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm (log for friends) problem (other friends prefer ECDLP).

On the other hand, if we know \\( k \\), we can compute in a very fast way \\( P=kg \\). This offers us a way to hide (in plain sight) things inside the group. Of course, if you could break the DLP, you could get \\( k \\), but it is rather infeasible. If we want to calculate \\( 65536g \\), we can do it by realizing that \\( g+g=2g \\), \\( 2g+2g=4g \\), \\( 4g+4g=8g \\)...until \\( 32768g+32768g=65535g \\), so we narrowed the operations 65536 to 16. There are many useful algorithms that allow us to speed up the operations over elliptic curves, allowing us to avoid expensive calculations such as inversions, which appear when we want to calculate the slope.
