# The discrete logarithm problem

Given a group, we can apply the operation repeatedly on a point \\( g \\) to get to a point \\( P \\), that is \\( g^k=g\times g\times g\times ... \times g=P \\). For example, in \\( (\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})^\star \\), \\( 5 \\) generates all the elements by successive multiplications with itself. We could then ask how many times \\( x \\) should we multiply \\( 5 \\) with itself to get to \\( 3 \\), that is, \\( 5^x\equiv 3 \pmod{7} \\). Since we know that the order of the group is \\( 6 \\), we should only concern ourselves with numbers \\( 0-6 \\). If we look above or try all combinations, \\( 5^5\equiv 3 \pmod{7} \\) so \\( x=5 \\). Similarly, if we look for \\( y \\) such that \\( 5^y\equiv 4 \pmod{7} \\), we get \\( y=2 \\). The problem of finding \\( x \\) so that \\( g^k=P \\) is known as the discrete logarithm problem (in number theory, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are known as indices). We quickly see that this logarithm works quite differently from the common logarithm on the real numbers (though the idea is the same, given \\( y \\), find \\( x \\) such that \\( e^x=y \\)). There is no obvious pattern, it is not increasing and if we had to search over a large set, it could be really daunting. Many cryptographic systems rely on the hardness of this problem over a finite cyclic group.
