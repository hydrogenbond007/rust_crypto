# Rings

The set \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) together with addition and multiplication forms a ring. The polynomials with ordinary addition and multiplication also form a ring. \\( n\times n \\) matrices also form a ring under addition and multiplication. Formally, a ring is a set \\( R \\) with two operations \\( + \\) and \\( \times \\) such that:
1. R is an abelian group under \\( + \\) (that is, R fulfills all the conditions for a group G1 to G4, plus commutativity, G5).
2. There is a multiplicative identity \\( e \\), such that \\( a\times e=e\times a=a \\). Frequently, we use \\( e=1 \\).
3. Multiplication is associative.
4. We have the distributive property of multiplication concerning addition.
